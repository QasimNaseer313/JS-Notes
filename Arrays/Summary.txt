Summary:

Shallow coopy 
   It uses heap.in whih the properties share the 
   same refrencce point.A change in one copy will
   cause the change in all refrenccce points
Deep copy:
   It uses heap.in whih the properties DO NOT share
    the same refrencce point.A change in one copy will
   NOT cause the change in all refrenccce points

4.Shift = removes first value of an array.
5. Includes = checks true or false.
6. IndexOf = checks the position of value in number form.
7.Join = converts to string.
8. Slice(value to remove from,value remove upto but don't include)= returns new array and original value remains unchanged. Use when you need to extract a portion of an array without modifying it.
9. Splice(value to delete from, number of value to delete) = returns new array with deleted one and original value changed.Use when you need to add, remove, or replace elements within an array.
